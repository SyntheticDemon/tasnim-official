# tasnim-official
Tasnim is at the moment  a local  panel for managing database relationships for a charity, the dash board provides basic utility for adding removing , deleting ,editing basic information and intends to become an automated charity websites with public access


As of patch 2.0 the panels provide minimal report functionalities for the admin , The next steps of upgrading this project is to add banking and transaction APIs , better reports ,
more specific and operations on  financial graphs.
One of the terminal goals is to have a user based charity that is publically available to everyone, with a profile , an account and much more user personalized features like personal reports 
A transition to REACT js might be possible since the project already relies heavily on AJAX and there is a very vague line between API calls and Django View Contexts
